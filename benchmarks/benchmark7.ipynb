    "The Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS) is a powerful technique for verifying the accuracy of a simulation code. In the MMS, one picks a desired solution to the problem at the outset, the \"manufactured solution\", and then determines the governing equation that will result in that solution. With the exact analytical form of the solution in hand, when the governing equation is solved using a particular simulation code, the deviation from the expected solution can be determined exactly. This deviation can be converted into an error metric to rigously quantify the error for a calculation. This error can be used to determine the order of accuracy of the simulation results to verify simulation codes. It can also be used to compare the computational efficiency of different codes or different approaches for a particular code at a certain level of error. Furthermore, the spatial/temporal distribution can give insight into the conditions resulting in the largest error (high gradients, changes in mesh resolution, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "After choosing a manufactured solution, the governing equation must be modified to force the solution to equal the manufactured solution. This is accomplished by taking the nominal equation that is to be solved (e.g.  Allen-Cahn equation, Cahn-Hilliard equation, Fick's second law, Laplace equation) and adding a source term. This source term is determined by plugging the manufactured solution into the nominal governing equation and setting the source term equal to the residual. Thus, the manufactured solution satisfies the MMS governing equation (the nominal governing equation plus the source term). A more detailed discussion of MMS can be found in [the report by Salari and Knupp][mms_report].\n",
    "\n",
    "In this benchmark problem, the objective is to use the MMS to rigorously verify phase field simulation codes and then provide a basis of comparison for the computational performance between codes and for various settings for a single code, as discussed above. To this end, the benchmark problem was chosen as a balance between two factors: simplicity, to minimize the development effort required to solve the benchmark, and transferability to a real phase field system of physical interest. \n",

The form of $\\alpha(y,t)$ was chosen to yield complex behavior while still retaining a (somewhat) simple functional form. The two spatial sinusoidal terms introduce two controllable length scales to the interfacial shape. Summing them gives a  \"beat\" pattern with a period longer than the period of either individual term, permitting a domain size that is larger than the wavelength of the sinusoids without a repeating pattern.
