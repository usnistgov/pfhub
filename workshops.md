An integral component of the CHiMaD [phase field benchmarking effort]({{ site.baseurl }}/#benchmarks)
is regular workshops and associated [hackathons]({{ site.baseurl
}}/hackathons).  Approximately twice a year, a spectrum of United States
and international researchers, ranging from graduate students to senior
scientists, come together to participate. These workshops help us formulate, 
test, and revise the benchmark problems. They are also a valuable venue for 
gathering additional feedback, such as helping developers of open-source codes 
find out how easily their software can be installed. Significant portions of 
the workshops are devoted to discussion, which helps the community become more 
integrated and enables us to work together to determine future needs and 
avenues of work.
