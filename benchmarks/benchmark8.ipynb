Finally, the problem also includes a convergence test with respect to mesh (spatial resolution). The closer the initial radius $r$ is to the critical radius $r^*$, the more sensitive the numerical integration will be to round-off errors. Therefore, a convergence test is included for $r_0=1.01r^*$ using successive runs each halving the average spatial mesh size $\\Delta x$ between consecutive runs. At least 3 runs are required to estimate the rate of convergence based on the $L^2$ error with the finest mesh being used as a gold standard.

This is repeated four times, each time with different random seeds, and the total free energy, time evolution of the solid fraction $Y$, discrete particle count $N$  (the number of disjoint regions with $\\phi=1$) are plotted for the five simulations, and Avrami plots are generated from the five simulations; from the Avrami plot the exponent $n$ is estimated and compared to the JMAK theory.\n",

This returns a tuple with a labeled array of unique features as the first item and a count of features as the second item.
