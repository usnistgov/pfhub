    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Precipitates are a key microstructural feature impacting the strength of alloys [[1][chawla1999mechanical]], and they are often elastically stressed, which affects their shape and their microstructure evolution during service.  Elasticity has long been incorporated into phase field models: indeed, Cahn's seminal paper on spinodal decomposition [<span data-proofer-ignore><a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/9781118788295.ch11\">2</a></span>] incorporates elastic strains due to composition fluctuations.  Eshelby presents an analytical solution for the elastic field of a single coherent, elastically stressed precipitate in an infinite matrix [<span data-proofer-ignore><a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspa.1957.0133\">3</a></span>], but the generalized problem of multiple interacting precipitates in a matrix with arbitrary crystal structure, lattice parameter misfit and elastic stiffnesses can only be solved numerically.  Sharp-interface approaches provide insight into equilibrium elastic shapes and coarsening under the influence of elastic stress [[4][voorhees1992morphological], [5][thompson1994equilibrium], [6][su1996dynamicsI], [7][su1996dynamicsII], [8][akaiwa2001large]], but these approaches have difficulty simulating precipitate splitting or merging. Early phase field formulations studying elastically stressed precipitates demonstrate the power of the method (e.g., Refs. [[9][wang1993shape], [10][wang1994effect], <span data-proofer-ignore>[11][wang1995shape]</span>]), and present-day studies have expanded to 3D simulations (e.g., Refs. [[12][goerler2017topological], [13][radhakrishnan2016phase], [14][shi2015microstructure], [15][cottura2015role]]) and formulations that include plasticity (e.g., Refs.

The free energy of the system, $\\mathcal{F}$, includes contributions from interfacial and elastic energy and is expressed as \n",

To have an equal area for an ellipse as a circle with radius $r$, we choose ellipse axes as $a_{[10]}=r/0.9$ and $a_{[01]}=0.9r$. Simulations are performed for two initial precipitate sizes: a smaller one with an area of $20^2 \\pi \\textrm{ nm}^2$ and a larger one with an area of $75^2 \\pi \\textrm{ nm}^2$. The center of each precipitate is embedded in the center of a square computational domain, which is given the coordinate (0,0).  The computational domain is $(400 \\textrm{ nm})^2$ for the smaller precipitates and $(1500 \\textrm{ nm})^2$ for the larger precipitates to allow long-range elastic fields to decay.  No-stress boundary conditions are applied for the displacements, and no-flux boundary conditions are applied for $\\eta$. Because our implementation is based on solving for displacements rather than strain, we specify $u_{[10]}=0$ at the top, middle, and bottom of the $y=0$ axis ($e.g.,$ in the [01] direction) and $u_{[01]}=0$ at the top, middle, and bottom of the $x=0$ axis ($e.g.,$ in the [10] direction) to remove the nullspace in the solution.

In addition, the precipitate may change size during the course of the energy relaxation because of the shifting balance between the $f_{\\text{bulk}}$ and $f_{\\text{el}}$ energy contributions.  Because the precipitate volume within the computational domain is much smaller than that of the matrix, a precipitate may shrink entirely away in the process achieving the equilibrium value of $\\eta$ in the matrix.  To avoid this, the initial value of $\\eta$ in the matrix should be set slightly greater than zero.  For the simulations with the small particles, we set $\\eta^{\\text{matrix}}_0=0.0065$, while for the large particles, $\\eta^{\\text{matrix}}_0=0.005$.
