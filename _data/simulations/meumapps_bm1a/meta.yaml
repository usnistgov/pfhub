  summary: "This simulation was performed using a currently unreleased version of MEUMAPPS, developed at Oak Ridge National Lab. This simulation does not have any adaptivity in time or space.\r\n\r\nSpatial discretization: Fourier-spectral\r\nTemporal discretization:  Semi-implicit backward Euler\r\nGrid: 128x128\r\nTime step: 0.1 \r\n\r\nI think spatially this simulation is pretty well converged. As far as temporal convergence goes, there are some qualitative differences in the early evolution if I use smaller time steps but the energy evolution doesn't change much. This simulation runs until the system is quite near to equilibrium."
