          The {{ site.title }} is a resource and forum for phase field
          practitioners ranging from novices to seasoned code
          developers. The contents of the {{ site.title }} is
          developed through community involvement with a special
          emphasis on providing links and information about codes and
          benchmark problems for phase field modeling. The primary
          goals are to host resources that
          <ul>
            <li>
              provide a set of benchmark problems that facilitate
              comparing and contrasting phase field codes as well as
              provide pedagogical examples for teaching and learning
              phase field methods,
            </li>
            <li>
              increase the adoption of phase field methods in
              engineering and scientific applications and aid in the
              development of quantitatively predictive phase field
              modeling,
            </li>
            <li>
              and, that foster an engaged and integrated phase field
              community with special emphasis on providing networking
              opportunities for graduate students and post-docs.
