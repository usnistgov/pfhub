    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Dendritic growth simulations are useful as benchmark problems being highly sensitive to both the phase field model formulation and the particular numerical implementation employed (see, for example,\n",
    "[[1][karma1998quantitative], [2][warren1995prediction]]). Historically, dendritic growth was one of the first applications of phase field modeling [[3][Fix], [4][Langer]], and remains a significant area of research today.  Previous analyses of both the sharp [[4][Langer], [5][collins1985diffuse], [6][kobayashi1993modeling], [7][mcfadden1993phase], [8][wang1993thermodynamically]] and thin interface limits [[10][karma1996phase], [1][karma1998quantitative], [11][mcfadden2000thin], [12][karma2001phase]] have demonstrated that the diffuse-interface phase field formulation is asymptotically equivalent to the sharp-interface Stefan formulation. In 2001, the introduction of an \"anti-trapping current\" to correct for solute trapping due to the jump in chemical potential at the solid/liquid interface [[13][karma2001phase], [14][echebarria2004quantitative]] facilitated quantitative phase field modeling of alloy solidification using unphysically large diffuse interface widths.  Today, massive increases in computing power and the advent of scientific computing on graphical processing units enable large-scale, quantitative 3D phase field simulations of growing dendrites (see, for example, [[15][hotzer2015large], [16][shibuta2015solidification]] and reviews [<span data-proofer-ignore><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2355/isijinternational.54.437\">17</a></span>, [18][granasy2014phase]]).\n",

    "## Parameterization and simulation conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "This section presents the specific details for the solidification and dendritic growth benchmark problem, including the model parameterization, initial conditions, boundary conditions, and computational domain size. The model is parameterized with dimensionless units, see the table below. While the diffuse interface width depends on orientation, it varies between four and five units, where the width is defined as the distance over which $-0.9 < \\phi < 0.9$. The benchmark problem is formulated for two dimensions.  To further reduce computational cost, we simulate one-quarter of a growing dendrite, as is commonly done in earlier works (e.g., Ref. [[1][karma1998quantitative], [2][warren1995prediction]]). One-quarter of a solid seed with a radius of eight units (with the position of the interface defined as $\\phi=0$) and a diffuse interface width of one unit is placed in the lower-left corner of the computational domain, surrounded by liquid.  Initially, the entire system is uniformly undercooled with $U \\left(t=0\\right)=\\Delta$.  This undercooling is chosen to challenge numerical solvers somewhat because it increases the thermal diffusion length and requires a larger computational domain size relative to more negative undercoolings.  We select a square computational domain of $(960 \\textrm{ units})^2$, which is two times longer than the long dimension used in Ref. [[1][karma1998quantitative]] for the same model parameterization. No-flux boundary conditions are chosen for $\\phi$ and $U$ on all domain boundaries.\n",
